# Let's write an OS
### Stumble into OS development with me

## About
I've always wanted to learn more about operating systems and how they work, so I finally decided to take
the plunge and jump head first into OS development. Make no mistake: I'm not an expert and I have zero
experience with operating system design or development. The OS that comes out the end of
this project (if any does; see [before getting started](https://github.com/stephpavlou/lets-write-an-os/text/before-getting-started.md)) will undoubtably be a flaming piece of junk, but I'm alright with that: this one's
about the journey.

## Contributing
I welcome all contributions to this project, especially the correcting of any errors, factual or
grammatical. The goal is just to learn a whole lot and document the process.
